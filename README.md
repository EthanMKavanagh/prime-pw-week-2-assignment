# prime-pw-week-2-assignment

This week we introduced the programming language of the Internet, JavaScript. With JavaScript we can make our websites smart by adding interactivity and logic.

## Topics Covered
* Variables and Constants
* Conditional statements


## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Files Provided

This week you'll be completing the scripts in the following files. But note, that we have different levels of difficulty.

- [ ] *aboutMe.js* (Base, Hard, Pro)

The file contains comments with prompts on what code to write. Do not erase the comments, just write the code below each commented line.

#### Modes

Above, we introduced the concept of levels of difficulty. "Mode" is how we will typically refer to each level. Below is a brief explanation of

* what to expect when attempting each mode
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
--- | ---
Base | required
Hard | optional, stretches your understanding
Pro | optional, stretches your understanding and may require additional research

**NOTE:** All the *.js* files are already sourced into *index.html*.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't edit or worry about any files other than the *.js* files.
