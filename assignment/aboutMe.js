// BASE MODE:
// create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name

// create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name

// create a third variable called `fullName`, and USING CONCATENATION, assign it the value of your first and last name

// console log the value of `fullName`

// create a variable called `age` and assign it the value of your age

// console log this sentence: 'My name is ______ ______, and I am ___ years old.'. Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.

// create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)

// create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food

// create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have

// create a variable called `friendsPets` and set it to the value of the number of pets your friend has

// add two pets to your pets variable

// create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice


// HARD MODE:
// create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Let's go on an adventure!", if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"

// create a compound conditional: if age is greater than 18 and adventurous is true, console log "Let's go!"

// Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!" if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`

// PRO MODE
// Write a conditional that assigns the value of the addition
// of the `pets` & `friendsPets` variables to a new variable called `totalPets` IF `pets` is greater
// than `friendsPets`. If `friendsPets` is greater than `pets`, assign the difference of the `pets` & `friendsPets`
// variables to `totalPets
